# (Re-)Discovering Forbidden Minors for Treewidth

Project code developed to accompany the thesis of the bachelor programme BSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, 
taught by Universiteit Maastricht. 
It consists in (re-)discovering Forbidden Minors for Treewidth, through a series of graph search/analysis techniques.

### Run Instructions
// Empty.

### Version Log
V1. Build the initial structure of the project.\
V2. List possible approaches to finding the forbidden minors.\
V3. Implementation of MySQL database structure and functions.\
V4. Synced the thesis report under documents.\
V5. Brute-force approach on generating all connected non-isomorphic graphs of n vertices (i.e. graphs fit for analysis)
AND algorithmic skeleton of finding forbidden minors.\
V6. Combinatorial enumeration approach implemented.\
V7. Binomial graph random sampling approach implemented, given the lack of feasibility 
of the brute-force graph generation process.\
V8. Combined approach (combinatorial enumeration up to 7 vertices AND random sampling thereon) implemented.\
V9.
