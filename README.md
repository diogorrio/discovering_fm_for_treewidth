# Minimal Forbidden Minors for Distinct Treewidths

Project code developed to accompany the thesis of the bachelor programme BSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, 
taught by Universiteit Maastricht. 
It consists in (re-)discovering Minimal Forbidden Minors for Treewidth, 
through a series of graph generation/analysis techniques.

### Abstract
The aim of this thesis is to explore the efficiency of algorithms dedicated to finding minimal forbidden minors in 
F(4), where F(k) is the finite set of graphs with the following property: a graph G has treewidth at most k if and 
only if none of the graphs in F(k) are a minor of G. The treewidth of a graph is a fundamental characteristic that 
describes its resemblance to a tree. This is crucial in graph theory, as it enables polynomial time solutions for 
NP-hard problems, for graphs with bounded treewidth. Methods of communicating the discovered forbidden minors to the 
community in a verifiable manner are developed, as only up the set F(3) are they fully known. Finally, the research 
aims to analyze the exhaustiveness of the obtained list of forbidden minors in F(4), as well as examine the 
feasibility of extending the algorithms used in F(4) in generating a non-exhaustive list for F(5).

To achieve these goals, the study employs graph generation and exploration techniques, search-space pruning methods, and 
connectivity and isomorphism checks. Different approaches are evaluated, and a MySQL database structure is implemented 
to facilitate the sharing of any research outcomes.

It defines an endeavor to advance the field of algorithmic 
graph theory and its possible applications in solving complex computational problems.


### Run Instructions
#### From scratch
```
If willing to use the database to test the algorithms:

1. Have a MySQL distribution installed.
2. Start a local server, by doing one of three things:
    a) Searching for the application 'Services' on Windows and starting MySQL80.
    b) Using the installed MySQL workbench to start it.
    c) Typing:
        net start MySQL80
    Don't forget to stop the server when you are done.
        net stop MySQL80
3. Assure the login credentials are set accordingly
4. Make use of the database functionalities.
    a) If you want access to the already found minimal forbidden minors:   
        Load the provided database file(s) under docs/results/sql on the server.
    b) If you don't need the data and only want to see the workings of the program:
        Simply run the code, it will create a database from scratch.
5. If you choose 4b), this is how you run the code:
    a) On PyCharm:
        << 'Edit Configurations...' >>
        << Type your local path to fm_finding\fm_utils\__init__.py on 'script path' >>
        << Select your Python interpreter >>
        << Have 'Add content roots to PYTHONPATH' and 'Add source roots to PYTHONPATH' selected >>
        You are good to run the program. 
        
The program will ask for your server credentials to gain access to modify the database in question.
```
