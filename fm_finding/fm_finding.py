# - HOW FAR IS A GRAPH FROM A BEING A TREE? -

# A graph G has threewidth 4 if there is a tree decomposition of G, denoted (T, X) where:
# T is a tree
# X is a set of subsets of vertices of G (BAGS) that satisfy the conditions:
# 1. EACH vertex of G is contained in AT LEAST 1 bag
# 2. For EACH edge (u, v) in G, there exists a bag in which both u and v are contained
# 3. For ANY vertex u, the bags containing u form a CONNECTED subtree in T
# 4. Size of EACH bag is AT MOST 4

# "In simpler terms, a treewidth 4 graph can be represented by a tree-like structure where each bag contains
# at most 4 vertices, and the bags capture the connectivity and relationships between vertices in the graph"

# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth#/media/File:Tree_decomposition.svg (* width *)
# tw is the MIN width over ALL tree-decompositions of a graph G (* threewidth *)

# - ON FORBIDDEN MINORS -

# "For every finite value of k, the graphs of treewidth at most k
# MAY BE characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors.
# i.e. ANY graph of treewidth > k includes one of the graphs in the set as a minor.
# EACH of these sets of forbidden minors includes AT LEAST one planar graph."
# (see Wagner's theorem on planar graphs)

# Some random, possibly useful theory notes:
# 1. Every complete graph K_n has treewidth nâ€“1
# 2. Treewidth is always AT LEAST the clique number minus one (~)
# 3. For k >= 4, the # of forbidden minors grows AT LEAST as quickly as the exponential of the square root of k
# However, this is only a LOWER BOUND - upper bounds are MUCH higher
# 4. Width is the # of vertices in a bag (after t.d.) - the -1 part has to do with the fact that trees should have tw 1
# 5. If H is a minor of G, then tw(H) <= tw(G)
# 6. ...

# - Process to find mfm for threewidth 4 (tw4) -
# TODO: Properly expand each point w/ relevant practical info
# 1. Preprocess the tw4 condition, i.e. ID forbidden subgraphs + any properties that are non-existent for tw4
# 2. Generate candidate graphs up to a certain number of vertices
# 3. Prune to eliminate graphs that are not eligible for tw4 (based on degree constraints, symmetry, ...) - reducing
# the search space - making the algorithm + efficient
# 4. Minor check the remaining candidate graphs for tw4, i.e. if a graph can be contracted to tw4 while preserving
# connectivity and vertex order (* graph minor *)
# 5. ID the mfms among the remaining graphs that fail the tw4 condition - they are the smallest graphs that are NOT
# contractible to tw4 (* min forbidden minors *)
# 6. Store in SQL DB
# 7. Iterate this whole process by increasing the nr of max vertices during the generation (or + pruning to narrow
# search space, if still too large)
# 8. Analyze the mfms, study properties and evaluate impact on tw4 computations - this may be helpful to understanding
# the constraints and structure of tw4 graphs

# TODO: Check if this is feasible for tw5
