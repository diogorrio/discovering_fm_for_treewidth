- HOW FAR IS A GRAPH FROM A BEING A TREE? -

A graph G has threewidth 4 if there is a tree decomposition of G, denoted (T, X) where:
    T is a tree
    X is a set of subsets of vertices of G (BAGS) that satisfy the conditions:
    1. EACH vertex of G is contained in AT LEAST 1 bag
    2. For EACH edge (u, v) in G, there exists a bag in which both u and v are contained
    3. For ANY vertex u, the bags containing u form a CONNECTED subtree in T
    4. Size of EACH bag is AT MOST 4

"In simpler terms, a treewidth 4 graph can be represented by a tree-like structure where each bag contains
at most 4 vertices, and the bags capture the connectivity and relationships between vertices in the graph"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth#/media/File:Tree_decomposition.svg (* width *)
tw is the MIN width over ALL tree-decompositions of a graph G (* threewidth *)

- ON FORBIDDEN MINORS -

"For every finite value of k, the graphs of treewidth at most k
MAY BE characterized by a finite set of forbidden minors.
i.e. ANY graph of treewidth > k includes one of the graphs in the set as a minor.
EACH of these sets of forbidden minors includes AT LEAST one planar graph."
(see Wagner's theorem on planar graphs)

Some random, possibly useful theory notes:
    1. Every complete graph K_n has treewidth nâ€“1
    2. Treewidth is always AT LEAST the clique number minus one (~)
    3. For k >= 4, the # of forbidden minors grows AT LEAST as quickly as the exponential of the square root of k
        However, this is only a LOWER BOUND - upper bounds are MUCH higher
    4. Width is the # of vertices in a bag (after t.d.) 
        (the -1 part has to do with the fact that trees should have tw 1)
    5. If H is a minor of G, then tw(H) <= tw(G)
    6. ...  
    (7. Should the degree of each one of the vertices be larger or equal to the actual tw we're looking for?)
    (8. Do all the vertices have to have the same degree as all the others?)
    (9. ...)
